									The usability design of an application or device is essential to user interaction and satisfaction with a product. Usability can be applied to many creations, but with the rise of Web 2.0 technologies, design implications have been analyzed due to the vast amount of users involved. A usability design should allow a user to be effective and efficient with an application while simultaneously putting forth minimal mental effort.
									<br></br>
									  There are many approaches to what a usability design entails however it is noted that functionality may now take precedence over the intuitive design of a product. High production rates of software applications since the early 2000’s have made it difficult to define an effective usability design. The content of an effective usability design involves user satisfaction, effectiveness, and efficiency within an application, however a method of measurement to asses these qualities is still undecided. 
									  <br></br>
	In a study by Nigel Bevan, Jurek Kirakowski and Jonathan Maissel titled What is Usability?, they suggest that the importance of usability is being undervalued. While many applications are now developed with a certain functionality to attract users, many lack an effective usability design. Nigel Bevan proposes that, “usability should be defined as the ease of use and acceptability of a product for a particular class of users carrying out specific tasks in a specific environment” (Bevan, 2009). The definition is effective in describing what a usability design should encompass when targeting specific consumers. In contrast many of the most effective products in the world have carried out specific tasks for the general population such as Facebook for networking, or Google for web searching. However the user group may be defined, the product itself may not have a practical, intuitive design. 
	<br></br>
	In order to measure a usability design, Nigel Bevan puts forth three criteria that reflect the user handling of a product in terms of user satisfaction, ease-of-use as it relates to mental effort, as well as acceptability and applicability to a defined task. Yong Ji et al. conduct a more physical analysis of what a mobile usability design should entail. Ji and his team created a “usability checklist” that consists of attributes that they believe create a standard for an effective design. They acknowledge the difficulty in evaluating a usability design for mobile phones due to rapid enhancements, modifications, and differences across brands. Ji’s paper is dedicated to “must-have” (Ji, 2006) amenities whereas researchers Andreas Sonderegger and Jurgen Sauer acknowledge that to many users, the experience while using a device is now a priority over its functionality. 
	<br></br>
	The article The influence of design aesthetics in usability testing: Effects on user performance and perceived usability employed a mobile phone simulation test to determine influence of appearance on perceived usability, performance measures, and perceived attractiveness. Sonderegger and Sauer’s theory that “consumer ergonomics”, which indicates that an aesthetically pleasing design could affect perceived usability, applies to mobile devices. Using teens as test subjects they distributed mobile phones with identical capabilities but different features in terms of attractiveness. Perceived usability was higher for appealing products than for unappealing ones, which suggests that perhaps an aesthetically pleasing design should be included as a criteria for a usability scheme. 
	<br></br>
	A study in 2004 by Moshe Zviran, Chanan Glezer and Itay Avni investigated user-based design and Web site usability based on user satisfaction. They used four types of websites: online shopping, customer self-service, trading, and subscription-based sites. The study acquired feedback from 359 respondents who assessed 20 different popular websites. Trading sites scored the lowest while shopping and customer self-service sites received the best feedback and results (Zviran et. al, 2005). E-commerce sites had terrible functionality in the mid 2000’s and since then have become enormous revenue streams with sites like Amazon, eBay and Groupon acquiring large market shares. Although this article was written in 2004, it is still a relevant study due to upshots similar to the e-commerce phenomena currently taking place. Mobile devices are presently experiencing rapid adjustments for usability designs because their expanse is reaching a large portion of the world’s population. 
	<br></br>
	Web 2.0 allows mobile devices to host applications that many people consider necessary components of life. “Web 2.0 is the network as a platform, spanning all connected devices” (O’reilly, 2007). The services provided by Web 2.0 allow the population to be in constant communication with peers and associates while also unpacking software on the fly. Web 2.0 harnesses collective intelligence and gives companies the advantage of improving their product as people help co-develop data stores. The technology being delivered to users now allows businesses to provide an unparalleled service to customers. Service businesses are now often conveyed through lightweight user interfaces on mobile devices. Reaching consumers on every platform has become a necessity for many business strategies, and an effective usability design in tandem with Web 2.0 technologies facilitate an effective outreach effort. 
	<br></br>
	 In the future there may be a quantifiable method to measure user response to a design. This will permit more feedback that could enhance a product by catering to specific user needs. Usability is currently focused on user satisfaction, ease-of-use, and efficient task management. There are different opinions concerning what should be included in an effective usability design and some variables are surprising given the current state of mobile technology and Web 2.0 capabilities. Mobile usability design is rapidly changing and methods for improving a user interface will continue to adopt new techniques. Evaluating mobile usability design is an important science because mobile phone integration in our lives has never been more apparent.
