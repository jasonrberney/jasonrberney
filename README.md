# Website for Jason Berney

Repository includes a website that I built for myself. It was originally created using an HTML5 UP template, and then edited for personal use. The website is now live and continually updated with blog posts. Having the code in Github allows me to work on the website from different machines, regardless of where I am. There are files in the repository that are not part of my live website but will remain because they might have some code I will want to reference someday in the future.
