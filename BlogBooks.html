									<h3><a name="Handmaid">January 2018. The Handmaid's Tale. Margaret Atwood. 311 Pages.</a></h3>
									<!--
										Atwood, Margaret. The Handmaid's Tale. New York: Anchor Books, a division of Penguin Random House LLC, 1998. Print.
									-->
								</header>
								<p id ="answers">
										Whether you're into reading or watching TV shows, odds are you've heard about <i>The Handmaid's Tale</i>. I had heard the title thrown around in conversation but hadn't ever received a detailed account of the plot. All I knew was that the story is fiction and there is a new Hulu television series based on the book. I'm always up for starting new shows, but when it comes to movies or series based on a book, I try and read the book first. The books are always better folks. 
										<br><br>
										This book was twisted. It really makes you feel squirmy and uncomfortable. Margaret Atwood is an incredible writer and in her introduction into The Handmaid's Tale she gives a recount of her process for coming up with this story. Here is my favorite excerpt from this introduction that foreshadows the chilling novel ahead:
										<br><br>
										"If I was to create an imaginary garden, I wanted the toads in it to be real. One of my rules was that I would not put any events into the book that had not already happened in what James Joyce called the "nightmare" of history, nor any technology not already available. No imaginary gizmos, no imaginary laws, no imaginary atrocities. God is in the details, they say. So is the devil." (Atwood, XIV)
										<br><br>
										Margaret Atwood is telling us that this story would be REAL. Real in the sense that many of the events in the book would be similar to real incidents that you and I have witnessed while watching the news on TV. For example, through the news or real life, we've all experienced religious extremism. Perhaps if you've ever driven through rural Utah then you've seen polygamist communities. I know that you have read about disappearances or shootings in the newspaper. Personal experiences such as these make this book more realistic, and in turn creating an exceptionally enticing and horrifying story. 
										<br><br>
										Definitely worth the read. Now on to the TV series!

									<h3><a name="Knight">October 2017. A Knight of Seven Kingdoms. George R.R. Martin. 355 Pages.</a></h3>
								</header>
								<p id ="answers">
									Every year when the Game of Thrones season comes to a close, I find myself desperate for more action.  After season one I picked up the paperback series A Song of Fire and Ice to continue the story line in my free time. I finished the series long before season 7 ended but once again found myself looking for more narratives of deception in Westeros. So I picked up a prequel written by George R.R. Martin called A Knight of Seven Kingdoms. Taking place roughly 100 years prior to the famed Game of Thrones series, the novel consists of three short stories that follow a hedge knight and an unsuspecting squire throughout Westeros. Their characters represent chivalry, discipline and determination to protect the realm of men in a time when rebellion could easily blossom into war.  If you are a Game of Thrones fanatic like me, this is definitely worth the read.

									<h3><a name="Dark">September 2017. Dark Money. Jane Mayer. 464 Pages.</a></h3>
								</header>
								<p id ="answers">
									Why does the Republican party currently dominate the House of Representatives? Why is there a GOP majority in the Senate? With a Republican leading the Executive branch of the United States government, NOW is the perfect time to read Dark Money. Do yourself a favor, find the answers to some of these questions through Jane Mayer’s extensive research on how a few of America’s richest families have influenced the electoral system to promote legislation which benefits themselves. This tight knit group of extremely wealthy conservative families, led by the Koch brothers, fund academic institutions, think tanks, congress, courts and other public or private organizations to spread their libertarian ideologies. This text is revealing and will make you want to get out and vote, not just for the presidency, but rally support for your local politics, because that is where these families are striking their influence, by assembling a base from the grassroots. This is definitely a book that every American should read.

									<h3><a name="Investor">August 2017. The Intelligent Investor. Benjamin Graham. 640 Pages.</a></h3>
								</header>
								<p id ="answers">
									A definitive text on value investing. Not your most exciting read, BUT if you are interested in a comfortable retirement someday, then this book is for you. Here I am, a 25-year-old just starting my career, wondering how on Earth I should invest in a way that my 65-year-old self will be taken care of. So, one of my friends turns me on to The Intelligent Investor. He warns me that some of the text, which was first written in 1949, is dull and dated, while most of the analysis formulated by Graham is still accepted in today’s popular approach to value investing. However, the commentary following every chapter is kept up to date, validating that the methodology Graham proposed over 50 years ago is still relevant in today’s financial world. If I had to guess, I’d say you may have never heard of Benjamin Graham, but you have probably heard of Warren Buffett, the most successful investor in the world. Buffett was Grahams protégée, so whether you’re interested in stocks or bonds, growth or value stocks, or are just looking for some strategy on your road to retirement, this is a great place to start.
