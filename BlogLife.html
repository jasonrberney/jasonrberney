									<h3><a name='TGM'>January 2018. Thurgood Marshall.</a></h3>
								</header>
								<p id ="answers">
									As I sit in seat 28A on Alaska Airlines flight 922, approaching Baltimore Maryland at 567 mph, I'm thinking of the man that the Baltimore International Airport is named for. Thurgood Marshall. This is a name I did not know much about until recently. Last week I watched the film Marshall. Set in 1940 when racism was still prominent in much of this country, the film tells the story of an African American man unjustly accused of a crime he did not commit. In a transitional time such as this, there were false incarcerations of individuals based on the color of their skin. Enter Thurgood Marshall. Lawyer for the NAACP, defending those individual's innocent of crimes they did not commit. I'll let you watch the movie to discover the ruling on the particular court case that is featured, but right now I want to focus on the true events that the film is based on. 
									<br><br>									
									I think films that are based on true events are great. I find them gripping. My favorite part of any film based on true events is the part right after the exaggerated recount of the historical events, and right before the credits. My favorite part are those facts, the real images from the true events and the authentic video taken in that time period. That information never ceases to dial in my attention and give me goosebumps. Marshall did not disappoint and left me with some jaw dropping facts and statistics. Thurgood Marshall was just 32 when he won his first case before the Supreme Court. He argued many cases that were vital to the civil rights movement, including Brown vs. Board of Education. Marshall was the first black man to be nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court and after his passing he was bestowed the highest civilian honor - the Presidential Medal of Freedom. 
									<br><br>									
									Thurgood Marshall International Airport, a dedication well deserved.

									<h3><a name='CFA'>December 2017. Come From Away.</a></h3>
								</header>
								<p id ="answers">
									I was recently in New York City. My uncle lives in Manhattan and has the coolest job on planet earth – Broadway Company Manager. He always has recommendations for the best plays to see when I’m back East.  This time around I saw a musical titled Come From Away. It told the true story of what happened to 38 aircraft and 7,000 passengers who were stranded in the small town of Gander Newfoundland on 9/11. The story of this small town, welcoming, sheltering and caring for thousands of strangers who unexpectedly arrived on their doorstep was incredibly uplifting in the midst of such a horrific event. The play had a level of intensity unlike anything I’ve experienced due to the atmosphere in the theatre. Sitting there with New Yorkers, many of whom may have lost family or friends in the terrorist attack 16 years ago, was extremely emotional. Nonetheless, the play was inspirational and focused on the gratitude of stranded civilians and the bonds that were formed through the devastating experience. If you’re in New York, or even if you aren’t, this one is worth the trip!

									<h3><a name='HIH'>October 2017. HUGO IS HOME.</a></h3>
								</header>
								<p id ="answers">
									We just brought home a puppy! He is a French Bulldog from an AMAZING breeder located in central Oregon (<a href="http://maiasminisupremes.com/" target="_blank">Maia’s Mini Supremes</a>). He is a fawn with unique white markings - check out those white booties! Our breeder could not have been more accommodating. Maia welcomed us into her home and impressively answered every question we could think of concerning our new companion. Having grown up with big Labrador Retrievers, I never thought I’d own an animal under 50 pounds. Yet here I am, having bought my first pet and he weighs 6 pounds as a pup, unlikely to ever exceed 30 pounds. I could not be more excited! We can already tell he is going to have the best personality and that level of cuteness will fill my everyday with smiles from ear to ear. Hugo Franc Berney, welcome to the family. <br><br>

									<h3><a name='IND'>September 2017. Indonesia.</a></h3>
								</header>
								<p id ="answers">
									Travel. I don’t think there is any better way to spend time or money. I love traveling and have been exploring this planet all my life, or at least as much as my schedule will allow. My latest venture took place during the first two weeks of September. My girlfriend and I flew into Jakarta, located on the island of Java, Indonesia. We quickly routed ourselves to Yogyakarta, which is known as the cultural epicenter of Indonesia. There, we observed the largest Buddhist temple in the world (Borobudur) and one of the largest Hindu temples (Prambanan)! We then spent a week in Bali, surfing in Kuta and hanging out in Ubud. Now <b>that</b> was a breath of fresh air. All the while, the Indonesian people were the nicest people I have ever met. It might have something to do with tourism underpinning the economy… BUT STILL. So nice. 
									<br><br>
									Lastly, we took another hopper flight over to Singapore. Wow, what a clean, well-designed city. If you end up there for whatever reason, you MUST check out the Gardens by the Bay and of course the observation deck on the Marina Bay Sands. Coincidentally, our visit also fell on the weekend of the legendary Singapore Grand Prix: Singapore F1 – Formula 1 Night Race. So that was pretty neat. What a trip. I’d recommend it to anyone. Safe travels!
